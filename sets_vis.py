#-----------Sets-----------------

#Task 1: Set intersection
#write a python code to find and print the intersection of the following two sets:

# set1={1,2,3,4,5}
# set2={4,5,6,7,8}
# #output should be: {4,5}
# set3=set1.intersection(set2)
# print(set3)

#Task 2:Set Union 
#write Python code to find and print the union of the following two sets:
# set1={1,2,3,4,5}
# set2={4,5,6,7,8}
# #output should be: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
# set3=set1.union(set2)
# print(set3)

#Task 3: Set Difference
#write Python code to find and print the elements present in SET1 but not in SET2:
# set1={1,2,3,4,5}
# set2 = {4,5,6,7,8}
# #output should be:{1,2,3}
# set3=set1.difference(set2)
# print(set3)

#Task 4: SEt Symmetric Difference
#write python code to find and print the symmertic difference of the following two sets:

# set1={1,2,3,4,5}
# set2={4,5,6,7,8}
# #output should be: {1,2,3,6,7,8}
# set3=set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
# print(set3)

#Task5: Set Membership Test.

#write python code to check if the element 3 is present in the set my_set:\

# my_set ={1,2,3,4,5}
# print( 3 in my_set )

#excercise 1: Set intersection.
# my_set1 ={10,20,39,40,50}
# my_set2 ={30,34,454,23}
# my_set3= my_set1.intersection(my_set2)
# print(my_set3)

#excercise 2: Set Union
# my_set1 ={10,29,34,998}
# my_set2 ={45,34,234,45}
# my_set3 = my_set1.union(my_set2)
# print(my_set3)

#excercise 3: Set Difference
# my_set1 ={100,23,898}
# my_set2 ={232,789,23,90}
# my_set3 = my_set1.difference(my_set2)
# print(my_set3)

#excerise 4: Set Symmetric Difference
#write a python script that finds and prints the symmetric difference between two sets.

# my_set1={12,23,564,44}
# my_set2={232,44,23,90}
# my_set3 = my_set1.symmetric_difference(my_set2)
# print(my_set3)
